### Jobs vs. Careers

While the terms "job" and "career" are often used interchangeably, they represent different concepts:

**Job**:
- A specific position or role
- Usually focused on immediate income
- May be temporary or short-term
- Often defined by specific tasks and duties
- May or may not align with long-term goals

**Career**:
- A long-term professional journey
- Encompasses multiple positions over time
- Involves progression and advancement
- Aligned with personal interests and goals
- Requires ongoing development and learning

### Self-Assessment: Discovering Your Path

Before exploring specific careers, it's important to understand yourself—your interests, skills, values, and personality traits.

#### Interests Assessment

Consider the following questions:
- What subjects do you enjoy studying?
- What activities do you lose track of time doing?

Skills can be divided into two main categories:

#### Values Clarification

Your work values are the aspects of a job or career that are most important to you. Consider which of these work values resonate with you:

- Independence and autonomy

### SMART Career Goals

Setting clear, well-defined goals is essential for career planning. SMART goals help ensure your objectives are achievable and measurable:

#### S - Specific
Your goal should answer the questions: What exactly do I want to accomplish? Why is this goal important? Who is involved?

*Example*: "I want to become a certified nursing assistant" is more specific than "I want to work in healthcare."

#### M - Measurable
Your goal should include criteria to track progress and determine when you've achieved it.

*Example*: "I will complete a certification program and pass the state exam" provides measurable milestones.

#### A - Achievable
Your goal should be realistic and attainable given your current situation and resources.

*Example*: An achievable goal considers your current education level, financial resources, and time constraints.

#### R - Relevant
Your goal should align with your broader career aspirations and personal values.

*Example*: If helping others is important to you, a healthcare career goal is relevant to your values.

#### T - Time-bound
Your goal should include a target date for completion.

*Example*: "I will complete my certification within 12 months" provides a clear timeframe.

### Career Development Plan

A career development plan outlines the steps needed to reach your career goals. It typically includes:

#### 1. Career Objective
