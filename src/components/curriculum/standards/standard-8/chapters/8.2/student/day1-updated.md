### Protecting Yourself When Shopping Online

#### Before You Buy

1. **Research the retailer**
   - Look for reviews of the company, not just the product
   - Check how long the website has been operating
   - Verify the company has a physical address and phone number

2. **Ensure the website is secure**
   - Look for "https" at the beginning of the web address
   - Check for a padlock icon in the address bar
   - Avoid shopping on public Wi-Fi networks

3. **Use strong, unique passwords**
   - Create different passwords for different shopping accounts
   - Consider using a password manager

4. **Be wary of deals that seem too good to be true**
   - Extremely low prices may indicate counterfeit products or scams
   - Compare with standard retail prices

#### During Purchase

1. **Use secure payment methods**
   - Credit cards generally offer better fraud protection than debit cards
   - Consider using digital wallets or payment services for added security
   - Never send cash or wire transfers to online retailers

2. **Only provide necessary information**
   - Be suspicious if a site asks for excessive personal details
   - Understand why the information is being requested

3. **Save records of your transaction**
   - Take screenshots of order confirmations
   - Save confirmation emails and order numbers

#### After Purchase

1. **Track your packages**
   - Use provided tracking numbers to monitor delivery
   - Report any suspicious delivery updates immediately

2. **Check your statements regularly**
   - Review credit card and bank statements for unauthorized charges
   - Report suspicious activity immediately

3. **Know your rights and the return policy**
   - Understand the retailer's return and refund policies
   - Be aware of consumer protection laws that may apply

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Jenna's Experience
Jenna needed a new pair of headphones. She researched different models online, read customer reviews, and found the exact model she wanted for 15% less than the local electronics store. She checked that the website used secure payment methods, kept her confirmation email, and received her headphones within three days.

### Example 2: Mike's Mistake
Mike found a popular gaming console on an unfamiliar website for 40% below retail price. Excited by the deal, he made the purchase without researching the site. After payment, he received only an automated email. The console never arrived, and when he tried to contact customer service, he discovered the website had disappeared. His credit card company helped him dispute the charge.

### Example 3: Thomas Takes Precautions
Thomas wanted to buy clothes online but was concerned about security. He created a separate email for shopping, used a credit card with fraud protection, checked that the website had "https" and a padlock icon, and kept records of his purchases. When one item wasn't as described, he successfully navigated the return process using the retailer's policy he had reviewed before purchasing.

## Reflection Prompt
